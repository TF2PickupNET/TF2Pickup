## Installation

### MongoDB

First you will need to install MongoDB. You will find the instructions [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

You will also need to make sure the MongoDB server is running before starting the server.

### Yarn (optional)

If you haven't installed yarn yet, you will need to now.
You can find the instructions [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/);

### Installing dependencies

```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Starting the server

```sh
$ yarn run start-dev
```

This will start the server on port 3000.
You can go then to http://localhost:3000 and access the site.

Changes you make will be updated on the website after you reload the website.
No need for restarting the server.
